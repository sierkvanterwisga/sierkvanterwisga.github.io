I am an astrophysicist working on the evolution of protoplanetary disks with a combination of observational data and models. My main research interests are the destruction of protoplanetary disks in different environments, and the composition of the gas that is potentially accreting onto young planets from the disk. To answer these questions, I work with large observational datasets from a wide variety of instruments, ranging from millimeter-wavelength interferometry at [ALMA](https://almascience.eso.org/) to optical spectroscopy at the [VLT](https://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/telescopes/ut.html). To understand these data I compare them with advanced physical-chemical models, such as DALI. The connecting thread in this research is to find out how protoplanetary disks form the wide variety of planetary systems we are currently discovering.

On this website, you can find my papers, CV, and recent talks, as well as contact information.
